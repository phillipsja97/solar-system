# Solar-System

## Description
Upon page load the application will have a Search Bar at the top of the page, and each planet name from the solar system will be printed on individual cards. When you hover over a planet name, the image of that planet will appear fully over the card. When you click on the card, it will bring up a full page card that has the planet name, image, description and facts about the planet. There should be an "x" in the top right to close the card and return to the individual printed planet name cards. The search bar should also let you type in a planet name and only the card that matches that name will show up.
